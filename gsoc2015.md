**Important:** This wiki is soon going to be taken down, as the official documentation of the Godot project is now on http://docs.godotengine.org.

## Compiled List of Ideas for GSOC 2015

### Terrain Support

Godot lacks a terrain engine. Most modern engines have this. Be it based on height-map or marching-cubes like. If you have experience with these kind of tools (either creating them or using them), Proposals Welcome!

### Binding GDScript to Java

Are you a capable Android developer and a master of Java? Godot has some code for binding Android API directly to GDScript, so the need to write native Java code for special features or integrating SDKs is reduced. This feature is done, but needs testing and making sure it's usable.

### Binding GDScript to Objective C

Are you a capable iOS developer? We would love to be able to make the Objective C iOS API available to GDScript. This should be possible given the dynamic nature of Objective C, but the main Godot developers are not that familiar with the language.

### Binding GDScript to .net

Are you a capable Windows developer? We would love to be able to make the .net API available to GDScript. This should be possible given the dynamic nature of .net CLR, but the main Godot developers are not that familiar with the platform.

### Optimization

Are you good at optimization? If you love vtune or valgrind, know your simd and know the cache levels better than your neighborhood, you could help us enormously. Godot is fast and has been written with most common optimizations in consideration, but not every part of it is as optimal as it can be and we are also not experts on the matter. If you believe this is for you, this task would consist of:

* Defining and creating common case scenarios for stress testing.
* Find ways to best optimize, either making the code faster or using more efficient algorithms.

### Size Optimization

Do you know what ELF and COFF means, and are familiar with how compiler tweaking works? We would like to make Godot binary smaller, but we don't have much experience with this. We know it's possible though, so if you have this kind of experience, please help us!

### RTL text support

Right-To-Left text support is missing (Arabic, Hebrew). If you are familiar with this (the main developers are not), please lend us a hand.

### IME Support

Input methods for complex non-latin character sets such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean is missing. If you are familiar with this, please lend us a hand.

### Keyboard Layout Mapping

Godot is missing keyboard layout tables to remap the scancodes, this makes working in some keyboard layouts a little inconvenient. Again, if you are familiar with these layouts, please lend us a hand.

### Flash Platform

This platform is stalled. The code in the repository was never tested. Adobe released Cross Bridge, which enables C++ code to run on the flash VM at pretty decent performance. The status of cross bridge is not clear and flash seems to be fading out as a platform, but support for it is still really strong.

### Android Signing and Jarsigner

We would like to replace the dependency on jarsigner by our own signing process for Android, this way we can remove the dependency on JDK, but we don't completely understand how this signing process works, so help is appreciated!

### iOS Signing and Codesign

Generating our own IPAs seems easy and there are tools to install them on iOS devices even under Linux or Windows, but we don't know much how the signature process works. Can you help us implement this on the iOS exporter, so Godot can do one click deploy to iOS devices under any OS? Everything we know so far to complete this task can be found on [this thread](http://www.godotengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=959). Only a few pieces are missing, but they're crucial.

### REST APIs

Making commercial games on mobile devices very often requires access to specific platform APIs such as ADs, analytcs, payments, monetization, install tracking, leaderboards, social networks, etc. From the most hippie-indie to the most unscrupulous-commercial of games always needs some interaction with these. Integrating these APIs to Godot is often very annoying because it requires to integrate SDKs written in different languages (Java/ObjC) to each platform and making custom binaries or templates. 

These APIs however (such as ADMob, Facebook, Play Services, etc) are in most of the cases available as REST, which enables them to function in all platforms with a single implementation, by just using HTTP, SSL and JSON (all well supported by Godot). 

If you want to write support for popular web APIs (Such as Google Play Services) as REST, please let us know!

### General AI

What kind of AI APIS are the most useful in the industry? Help defining this would, again, be appreciated.
