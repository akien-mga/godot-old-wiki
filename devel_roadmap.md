**Important:** This wiki is soon going to be taken down, as the official documentation of the Godot project is now on http://docs.godotengine.org.

# Godot Roadmap

These are just tentative to have a rough idea of the development plan. Ideas and helping set better priorities are always welcome.

**Update (November 2015)** This page is outdated (as is the rest of the GitHub wiki), please refer to: http://godotengine.org/projects/godot-engine/wiki/Documentation  
The GitHub wiki will soon be shut down.

**Update (June 2014)** Some changes in the roadmap happened due to mostly our internal development schedule at Okam (features Juan needs to do for our games in course), basically 1.0 will have a few more features taken from 1.1 and will come out a little later.

**Update (September 2014)** Feature set was met for 1.0, currently focusing on stabilizing (fixing issues and pulls), and filling missing docs for a tentative end of the month release.


~~### Godot 1.0 (stable) (~December 2014)~~

* Lightmapping
* 2D Deforms and Skeletons
* More Shaders (Lighting)
* Navmesh support
* Focus on Stability and Usability
* Complete Documentation (how much? time should tell)
* First stable, versioned release.


~~### Godot 1.1 (~May-2015)~~
* Improved Code Completion
* Visual Shader Editor
* 2D Engine Rewrite (Faster and support Z per node)
* 2D Shader support
* 2D Light & Shadows support

### Godot 1.2 (~October-2015)

* Improve debugger
* Live Scene Editing
* Complete UI Rework (rewrite UI, make it more friendly)
* This includes more UI related tasks that will be filled later

This release will take a long time given the huge amount of feedback from the growing community.
However, we'll try to do more point releases inbetween.

### Godot 1.3 (~February-2016)
* Better Networking Support.
* Ragdoll Wizard/Helper (can be done manually now but it's a lot of work)
* OpenGEX or FBX Import (ASSIMP? or blender did it..)
* Easier deployer for iOS and NaCL
* Windows Universal Binary support (API should exist now?)

### Godot 1.4 (Sometime in 2016)

* Vulkan Backend
* Post Process Shaders
* Support for Terrain 
* Support for texture splatting & decals
* Reflections (using reflection probes)
* SSAO, LPV, and more modern visual effects. Let's put Unreal 4 and Cryengine to shame
* Improved Navmesh Support (Crowds)
* Make Audio System Graph-Based

### Future

* Add optional typing to GDScript
* Ideas?
