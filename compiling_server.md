# Compiling for Unix (Headless)

### Use Case


Godot is mainly used for creating client-side games and applications. However, there are many scenarios where a headless (no display or audio) version might be required, such as:

*  Automated Scripts (Running single scripts with a specific purpose)
*  Automated Export (Exporting a project for a specific platform, useful for continuous integration)
*  Running a server accepting connections (Godot is perfectly capable of running as a server).
