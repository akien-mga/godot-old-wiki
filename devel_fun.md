# Fun tasks!

The following is a list of fun tasks to do. If you want to work on any of them, let the developers know on the [Developer's Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/godot-engine).

### Terrain Support

Godot lacks a terrain engine. Most modern engines have this. Be it based on height-map or marching-cubes like. If you have experience with these kind of tools (either creating them or using them), Proposals Welcome!

### Demos on Mobile

Many Godot demos do not work well on mobile because touchscreen input methods are not supported. If you want to give it a try implementing this, let us know!

### Binding GDScript to Java

Are you a capable Android developer and a master of Java? Godot has some code for binding Android API directly to GDScript, so the need to write native Java code for special features or integrating SDKs is reduced. This feature is done, but needs testing and making sure it's usable.

### Binding GDScript to Objective C

Are you a capable iOS developer? We would love to be able to make the Objective C iOS API available to GDScript. This should be possible given the dynamic nature of Objective C, but the main Godot developers are not that familiar with the language.


### RTL text support

Right-To-Left text support is missing (Arabic, Hebrew). If you are familiar with this (the main developers are not), please lend us a hand.

### IME Support

Input methods for complex non-latin character sets such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean is missing. If you are familiar with this, please lend us a hand.

### Keyboard Layout Mapping

Godot is missing keyboard layout tables to remap the scancodes, this makes working in some keyboard layouts a little inconvenient. Again, if you are familiar with these layouts, please lend us a hand.
