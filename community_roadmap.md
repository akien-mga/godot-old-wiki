# Community Roadmap

## Introduction

Want to help to make Godot grow? As mentioned before, the biggest obstacle for this is not features lacking or anything of the sort. Godot will only grow once more people finds out about it, and once there is a large enough developer community creating and sharing content. 

As such, we have put together this roadmap on the things we would like to happen in the community in the future to ensure that Godot is more accessible. They are mostly unrelated items, but we will need help for this to happen.

## Asset Sharing

An asset store is not on the map in the short term (though anyone is free to create one). For a game engine to gain more widespread adoption nowadays it needs a way for the community to share their assets. From simple shaders to full blown game templates. From Godot side, we hope the new UI and plug-in system will allow to make this much easier, but a community website for this would be vital. Want to help with this? Let us know!

## Showcase Demos

Godot comes with many functional demos, but they are designed as learning tools (only what is required is presented in them). A list of features is often not enough to convince someone to give a game engine a try, so beautiful looking demos are a must. If you are an accomplished 2D or 3D artist, your help here is vital! 

## Documentation Sharing

The current wiki (this) is only writable by developers. We are in the process of moving docs and tutorials to a more openly accessibly wiki, so we can centralize everything. This will take some time but it's top priority.

## Open Talks

Everywhere in the world there are many places were talks about a free and open game engine such as Godot would be very welcome. From schools and universities to cultural centers. Godot community should provide whoever wants to do this with template talks in several languages.

## Open Training Materials

Likewise, materials for teaching how to make videogames using Godot (slides, examples, evaluation guidelines, etc) in various languages should be created and made available to anyone who would want to do this at their local city.
